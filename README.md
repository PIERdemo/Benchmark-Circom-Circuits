# Benchmark_Circuits

This repository contains the benchmark for circom circuits. In order to understand the time and memory consumption a report csv file is generated for each circuit. The report contains the following information:

- Circuit name
- Input size
- Number of constraints
- Time to compile and generate the witness
- Memory to compile and generate the witness
- Time to setup the proof
- Memory to setup the proof
- Time to generate the proof
- Memory to generate the proof
- Time to verify the proof
- Memory to verify the proof
