This repository is dedicated to a powerful and user-friendly framework designed for testing various circuits using Circom. Our main objective is to simplify the testing process, allowing developers to easily add new circuits and conduct reliable tests.

**Key features of the framework:**

1.  **Extensibility:** The framework is highly extensible. To add new circuits, simply follow a few clear rules and place the circuits in the `circuits/base` folder. Additionally, provide a commented `main` file following the appropriate formatting.
    
2.  **Easy Customization:** You can effortlessly customize circuit values using Python. Just make the necessary changes in the test files within the `circuits` directory to update the circuit name, powersoftau, and other relevant parameters.
    

**Getting Started:**

1.  Clone this repository to your local system.
2.  Add new circuits to the `circuits/base` folder.
3.  Modify the `main` file of the circuit with the correct formatting and values to be customized in Python.
4.  Edit the test files in the `circuits` directory to adapt them to the new circuit, updating the circuit name, powersoftau, and other parameters as needed.
5.  Run the tests to ensure the circuit functions correctly.
